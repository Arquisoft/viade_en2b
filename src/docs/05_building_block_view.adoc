== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

The above decomposition eases the development by a fair margin, as the division of tasks is more direct among the development team members; the team has two sub-units, front-end and back-end, and this division clearly states what should be done mostly by each sub-unit, and how they should coordinate to make everything connected. The different modules are created upfront, and from there every member will know what will be connected to what they are creating.

Contained Building Blocks::
* **Viade**: The main application, the project being created.

Important Interfaces::
* **Pod provider**: Any Pod provider available for the user to choose. Crucial for the application to be able to connect to the user's Pod.
* **User's Pod**: The data storage of the user. The application will have access to it, to move the necessary data to provide its functionalities.
* **User**: The user, which has access to the application, and gives their permission for it to manipulate their Pod, so they can access the functionalities of the application.

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

==== Level 1 - Viade

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

* **Purpose/Responsibility**: Viade is a route-management system that lets users create routes and share them with their friends, and is based in the Solid specifications. It is based on a layered architecture with layers connected through facades.

* **Contained Building Blocks**:
** **Interface Layer**: The layer with which the user will directly interact. It has all the components related with the user interface, and it relies on the _Control Layer_ to get any needed data to output to the user.
** **Control Layer**: Layer that deals with receiving requests from the _Interface Layer_, do different requests to the _Data Access Layer_, receive the data, construct the needed components and send them to the _Interface Layer_.
** **Data Access Layer**: This layer will transform requests from the _Control Layer_ to requests to the User's Pod. In some cases it will retrieve data, and it will process it accordingly so the _Control Layer_ can receive it and use it.

* **Interfaces**: 
** **Cache**: The cache is a component which has the sole purpose of intercepting and saving data going through the layers of the application, so the retrieving of data is faster because it is saved in memory.
